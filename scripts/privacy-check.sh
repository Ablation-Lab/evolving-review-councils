# Privacy check for Ablation Lab repos. Runs before every commit through the pre-commit hook
# (enable once per clone with: git config core.hooksPath .githooks). It can also be run by hand.
#
#   privacy-check.sh             scan the staged content (exactly what the next commit will contain)
#   privacy-check.sh --worktree  scan the working tree instead: tracked, modified and untracked files
#
# It looks for:
#   - generic patterns listed below (personal email, secrets, local paths, hardware terms), and
#   - private patterns from .privacy/patterns.txt in the repo root. That file must be git-ignored
#     (keep a .privacy/.gitignore containing "*") and never committed; the check refuses to run otherwise.
#     PRIVACY_PATTERNS=<path> overrides the location.
#
# Known-safe lines can be listed in .privacy-allow (committed). Each entry is the SHA-256 of
# "<path>:<exact line text>", so the allow-list never repeats the text and only that exact line in
# that file is allowed; any edit to the line makes it a match again. Print the hash for a line with:
#   privacy-check.sh --hash <path> <line number>
#
# It fails loudly. Exit codes:
#   0  passed: every pattern ran and nothing matched
#   1  matches found: the commit is blocked
#   2  the check itself is broken (a pattern failed to run, the private list is missing, empty,
#      not ignored or tracked, no files to check, or the self-test failed): the commit is blocked
